Thin Tabs
---------

Thin Tabs is a fork of [Small Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/small-tabs/)
written by ロシア and is under the Mozilla Public License v2.

Thin Tabs is designed to work best with the [Classic Theme Restorer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/classicthemerestorer/)
Squared Tabs (v1 and v2). You can use it with the Australis default tabs, too,
but it looks beyond abysmal.


Build
-----

Run make...or if you don't know what make is, zip the whole src directory and
change the file ending to xpi.
