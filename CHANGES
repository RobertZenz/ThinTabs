1.5.3
-----

Attention: Because of the changes needed for TabMix Plus, you may need
           to recalibrate your settings (the defaults have been adjusted).
           I'm sorry for that, but it was inevitable in the end.

 * Minimum required Firefox version is no 4.0.
 * Removed the nonsense padding below the tabbar.
 * Added setting to completely hide the tabbar.
 * Added setting to hide the text of the tabs.
 * Added setting to force a certain width of tabs.
 * Added Thunderbird support.
 * Added TabMix Plus support (Multirow tabbar).

Known bugs:

 * Setting the tab width does nothing in Thunderbird.
 * Changing the heights of the tabs while the multirow tabbar is active
   might lead to visual glitches (tabbar too small or large for the tabs).
   A restart of Firefox *might* be required, could also be that fiddling
   with the row setting of TabMix Plus fixes it, or closing tabs until
   the tabbar collapses to one row. 1.4.1
